# XSharpX

XSharpX is a general library for functional programming using .NET languages.

It provides purely functional data structures to complement those from
the BCEL. There is an intention is to integrate with several .NET
languages such as [F#](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fsharp/),
[CÏ‰](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/comega/)
and [Nemerle](http://nemerle.org/About/) for the purpose of demonstrating
capability. At this moment, XSharpX uses C# exclusively for implementation.
